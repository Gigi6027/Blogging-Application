# Blooging-Application


▪ A blogging website was developed with Vue.JS as the frontend application and Flask 
framework and Python for backend API calls.

▪ SQLAlchemy was used as the ORM, Redis as the message broker, and RQ worker for 
executing relevant functions.

▪ Cron jobs were implemented to send daily reminder emails to subscribers who 
hadn't posted any content.

▪ MailGun was used for email delivery and Insomnia to test the API.
▪ The API was published using Swagger and SQLite was utilized as the database.

▪ API caching was implemented to enhance website performance.
